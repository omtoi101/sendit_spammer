## instructions pt 2

### chromedriver,
You will need to get the official chrome driver, and put it in the same directory as the sendit_spammer.py

You can get the chromedriver.exe from googles website here https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
get the version that matches your installed chrome version, if you dont have chrome installed then install it and download the latest chromedriver.
the folder should look like this now!

## instructions pt 3

### Executing !
Run the sendit_spammer.py by double clicking it, py'ing it in the terminal or using an IDE like pycharm to execute it, it doesn't really matter.


When the script runs it should look like this:

(if you are just double clicking it)

If you see something like this before the previouse image then it is just auto installing the required imports

After finished installing all the imports it will ask for a url;

What you want to do is get your sendit link eg:
https://web.getsendit.com/s/edeef98b-f2ea-4b68-93ee-c1584657d969?sc_ewa=1&sc_ewa_page_id=ewa_snapkit_fake_snap_id_prefixfa58lolnotgettingmyurl:)5ca-01219-a7L2-f5d7-fcd5dbcedaec

and chop it off at the question mark

https://web.getsendit.com/s/edeef98b-f2ea-4b68-93ee-c1584657d969 ? sc_ewa=1&sc_ewa_page_id=ewa_snapkit_fake_snap_id_prefixfa58lolnotgettingmyurl:)5ca-01219

And get the first part of the link eg:

https://web.getsendit.com/s/edeef98b-f2ea-4b68-93ee-c1584657d969

And now thats the link you want to input into the sendit url part on the spammer.

Now put your message in the next field.

After you have entered the fields a chrome window should pop up and start messaging, sending, refreshing and repeating.
If this happens then the spammer is working !!


Otherwise that brings me to my next section.
